# Project Prism: Customer Segmentation & Strategic Marketing Dashboard ðŸ“Š

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis and business intelligence case study.  
The primary goal was to segment a company's customer base into distinct, meaningful groups using their purchasing behavior.  

The final deliverable is an actionable analysis and a professional dashboard that can be used to inform targeted marketing and sales strategies.

## Key Findings & Insights

The analysis successfully identified **four distinct customer segments**:

- **The Loyal Champions**: Our most valuable customers who purchase recently, frequently, and spend the most.  
- **The Promising Newcomers**: A new customer segment with recent purchases but low frequency, representing a key growth opportunity.  
- **The At-Risk Customers**: Customers who used to be frequent buyers but have become less active and are in danger of churning.  
- **The Lapsed Customers**: The least active segment, with low spending and no recent purchases.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the segmented analysis, specific strategies were developed for each customer group:

- **For The Loyal Champions**: Focus on reward and retention with loyalty programs and exclusive offers.  
- **For The Promising Newcomers**: Encourage repeat purchases with personalized recommendations and welcome-back campaigns.  
- **For The At-Risk Customers**: Re-engage them with targeted campaigns and special discounts.  
- **For The Lapsed Customers**: Implement "win-back" campaigns with aggressive, time-sensitive offers.
