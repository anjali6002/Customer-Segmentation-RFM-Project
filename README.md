Project Prism: Customer Segmentation & Strategic Marketing Dashboard 
Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis and business intelligence case study. The primary goal was to segment a company's customer base into distinct, meaningful groups using their purchasing behavior. The final deliverable is an actionable analysis and a professional dashboard that can be used to inform targeted marketing and sales strategies.

Key Findings & Insights
The analysis successfully identified four distinct customer segments:

The Loyal Champions: These are our most valuable customers who purchase recently, frequently, and spend the most.

The Promising Newcomers: A new customer segment with recent purchases but low frequency, representing a key growth opportunity.

The At-Risk Customers: A group that used to be frequent buyers but has become less active and is in danger of churning.

The Lapsed Customers: The least active segment, with low spending and no recent purchases.

Strategic Recommendations
Based on the segmented analysis, specific strategies were developed for each customer group:

For The Loyal Champions: Focus on reward and retention with loyalty programs and exclusive offers.

For The Promising Newcomers: Encourage repeat purchases with personalized recommendations and welcome-back campaigns.

For The At-Risk Customers: Re-engage them with targeted campaigns and special discounts.

For The Lapsed Customers: Implement "win-back" campaigns with aggressive, time-sensitive offers.

Technologies & Methodologies
Data Analysis: Performed using Python (Pandas) for data cleaning, preparation, and feature engineering.

Methodology: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis was used to quantify customer behavior.

Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering was applied to segment customers, with the Elbow Method used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Business Intelligence: An interactive dashboard was built using Power BI to visualize the analysis and recommendations.
